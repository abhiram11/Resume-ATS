# Smart ATS Resume Analyzer

### Problem Statement

In today's competitive job market, job seekers face challenges ensuring their resumes align with job descriptions, meeting the criteria of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). ATS filters often reject resumes that lack specific keywords or don't match job requirements, reducing the chances of securing interviews. At the same time, job posters struggle with receiving a high volume of irrelevant applications, which increases the time and effort needed to identify qualified candidates. This creates a dual need for a tool that not only helps job seekers optimize their resumes for ATS compliance and highlight areas for improvement but also assists job posters in receiving better-matched, more qualified applicants.
